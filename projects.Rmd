This paper systematically and quantitatively characterizes interaction dynamics and community formation based on changes in spatial patterns of contemporaneous households. We develop and apply a geo-spatial routine to measure changing extents of household interaction and community formation from A.D. 600â€“1280 on the Mesa Verde cuesta in southwestern Colorado. Results suggest that household spatial organization was shaped simultaneously by the maintenance of regular social interaction that sustained communities, and the need for physical space among households. Between A.D. 600 and 1200, households balanced these factors by forming an increased number of dispersed communities in response to increases in population and variable environmental stressors. However, as population rebounded after the mid-1100s megadrought, communities became increasingly compact, disrupting a long-standing equilibrium between household interaction and subsistence space within each community. The vulnerabilities this change in community spatial organization created were compounded by a cooler climate, drought, violence, and changes in political and ritual organization in the mid-A.D. 1200s, which ultimately culminated in the complete depopulation of the Mesa Verde cuesta by the end of the thirteenth century.

Archaeologists are inherently limited in their understanding of the past by the quality and quantity of data available. In the U.S. Southwest, we are fortunate to work in a region with a high degree of preservation and long history of archaeological inquiry. Because we work in a region with a dense and well-known archaeological record, we sometimes take what we know for granted and do not critically examine our assumptions. In the Mesa Verde region, extensive survey and excavation have revealed high population densities between A.D. 600 and 1300 both on and off the Mesa Verde cuesta. We have a knowledge gap, however, on the Mesa Verde North Escarpment. With limited habitation information, we assume the North Escarpment was less densely occupied than the immediately surrounding regions, but our assumptions are the product of missing data and not necessarily a reflection of settlement patterns and landscape use. This poster synthesizes what we currently know, what we do not, and employs a predictive model using the limited available data to help us better understand how the Mesa Verde North Escarpment may have been utilized from A.D. 600--1300.
