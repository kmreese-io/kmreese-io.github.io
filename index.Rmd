I am a computational social scientist specializing in large-scale geospatial analyses utilizing archaeological datasets. My research explores the complexities of community development, occupation, and resiliency of subsistence-farmers during periods of sustained climate change in ecologically marginal spaces. I specialize in Ancestral Pueblo archaeology of the northern U.S. Southwest from AD 450--1300, and my experience includes extensive fieldwork in the Four Corners region, and several years of directing pedestrian survey on the Mesa Verde North Escarpment in southwestern Colorado.

I hold a PhD in Anthropology from the University of Notre Dame, an MA in Anthropology from Washington State University, and a BA in Political Science and Anthropology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Notre Dame, and a Research Associate at the Santa Fe Institute.
