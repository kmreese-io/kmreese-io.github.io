I am a computational social scientist with extensive experience utilizing large-scale geospatial analyses with archaeological datasets. My research explores the complexities of community development, occupation, and resiliency of subsistence-farmers during periods of sustained climate change in ecologically marginal spaces. I specialize in Ancestral Pueblo archaeology of the northern U.S. Southwest from AD 450--1300, and my experience includes a decade of fieldwork in the Four Corners region, with several years of directing pedestrian survey on the [Mesa Verde North Escarpment in southwestern Colorado](https://the-journal.com/articles/156383-pueblo-villages-thrived-on-mesa-verde-escarpment).

I hold a Ph.D. and M.A. in Anthropology from the University of Notre Dame, an M.A. in Anthropology from Washington State University, and a B.A. in Political Science and Anthropology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

I am currently working as an Environmental Professional 2 in the Environmental Stewardship Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory while maintaining research affiliations with the Santa Fe Institute, Crow Canyon Archaeological Center, and the Research Institute at Crow Canyon. 

I am also a strong advocate for the production and dissemination of free and open source research, and work to increase accessibility to powerful computational tools by writing and [releasing the code I have used in all of my publications](https://kmreese.io/projects.html).
